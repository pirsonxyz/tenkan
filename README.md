# Convert your .env files to c headers!
## why?
because i'm doing embedded development and want to have a way to programmatically use environment variables without having to manually write them
## usage
```
tenkan 
tenkan <header name>
tenkan <header name> <.env path>
tenkan version || tenkan v #to show tenkan's current installed version
```
tenkan's default file is tenkan.h
